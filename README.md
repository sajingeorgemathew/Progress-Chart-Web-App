# Development Phases UI

A small, static UI for tracking the product phases. Edit `content.json` to keep it updated.

## How to run

Option 1: open `index.html` directly in a browser.

Option 2: serve locally for cleaner refresh behavior:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`.
